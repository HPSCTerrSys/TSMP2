## Introduction 

The Terrestrial System Modeling Platform v2 (TSMP2, https://www.terrsysmp.org) is an open source scale-consistent, highly modular, massively parallel regional Earth system model. TSMP essentially consists of an interface which couples dedicated versions of the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic ([ICON](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/iconpublic)) atmospheric model in NWP or climate mode, the encore Community Land Model ([eCLM](https://hpscterrsys.github.io/eCLM)), and the hydrologic model [ParFlow](https://www.parflow.org) through the [OASIS3](https://oasis.cerfacs.fr/en/)-[MCT](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mct/) coupler.

TSMP allows for a physically-based representation of transport processes of mass, energy and momentum and interactions between the different compartments of the geo-ecosystem across scales, explicitly reproducing feedbacks in the hydrological cycle from the groundwater into the atmosphere.

TSMP development has been driven by groups within the [Center for High-Performance Scientific Computing in Terrestrial Systems](http://www.hpsc-terrsys.de) (HPSC-TerrSys).

## Quickstart

Please see [quickstart section](https://hpscterrsys.github.io/TSMP2/users_guide/building_TSMP2/Quickstart.html) for guided steps on how the model can be build.
