# The Terrestrial Systems Modelling Platform v2 (TSMP2)

The Community Land Model is the land model for the Community Earth System Model (CESM). It focuses on modeling the land as the critical interface through which humanity affects, adapts to, and mitigates global environmental change. It includes a comprehensive representation of land biogeophysics, hydrology, plant physiology, biogeochemistry, anthropogenic land use, and ecosystem dynamics across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The central theme is that terrestrial ecosystems, through their cycling of energy, water, chemical elements, and trace gases, are important determinants of climate.
The model represents several aspects of the land surface including surface heterogeneity and consists of components or submodels related to land biogeophysics, the hydrologic cycle, biogeochemistry, human dimensions, and ecosystem dynamics. Specific processes that are represented include:

-	Vegetation composition, structure, and phenology
-	Land management including crops and crop management and wood harvest
-	Ecosystem Demography (FATES, optional)
