# Introduction to TSMP2

The Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP, https://www.terrsysmp.org) is a scale-consistent, highly modular, physics-based, massively parallel, and fully integrated groundwater-vegetation-atmosphere modeling framework for regional climate system modeling. TSMP is composed of the atmospheric models [ICON](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/icon-model_coup-oas), the land surface model encore Community Land Model ([eCLM](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/eCLM)), and the [ParFlow](https://github.com/parflow/parflow) subsurface-surface hydrological model, coupled using OASIS3-MCT. TSMP is applied across a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, ranging from field to continental scale in a variety of applied research topics, such as water resources, land-atmosphere coupling and climate change projections.

The following section will give you a brief overview of TSMP2.
