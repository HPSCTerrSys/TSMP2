# The Terrestrial Systems Modelling Platform v2 (TSMP2)

The Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP, https://www.terrsysmp.org) is a scale-consistent, highly modular, physics-based, massively parallel, and fully integrated groundwater-vegetation-atmosphere modeling framework for regional climate system modeling. TSMP2 is composed of the atmospheric models ICON, the land surface model encore Community Land Model (eCLM), and the ParFlow subsurface-surface hydrological model, coupled using OASIS3-MCT. TSMP2 is applied across a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, ranging from field to continental scale in a variety of applied research topics, such as water resources, land-atmosphere coupling and climate change projections.
